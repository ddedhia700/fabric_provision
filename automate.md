Architectural Decision Record: Automated Switch Port Activation System
Title
ADR-001: Implement a Centralized Automated Switch Port Activation System

Status
Proposed

Context
Manual switch port activation for servers is a critical bottleneck in data center operations, slowing server builds and limiting scalability. The current process:

Delays Server Builds: Manual port activation takes hours, delaying server provisioning and customer deployments, which impacts revenue.
Lacks Flexibility: Cannot dynamically change switch configurations (e.g., VLANs, port modes) during the server build workflow, requiring separate manual steps.
Causes Errors: Human errors lead to misconfigurations, causing downtime (estimated $Y per incident).
Unscalable: Struggles with growing demand (100-200 servers, thousands of ports).
To address these issues, we need a solution that:

Speeds up server builds by automating switch port activation as part of the provisioning process.
Enables dynamic switch configuration changes (e.g., VLAN assignments) during the server build workflow.
Supports web UI requests from requestors.
Allows API requests from automation controllers.
Handles bulk activation (thousands of ports) via scripts.
Provides a CLI for NetOps ad-hoc changes.
The solution must deliver faster server builds, flexible configuration, cost savings, scalability, and reliability, while ensuring security and ease of use.

Decision
We will build a Centralized Automated Switch Port Activation System with:

Web UI: For requestors to submit/track port activation and configuration requests.
RESTful API: For automation controllers and bulk scripts to trigger port activations and switch configuration changes (e.g., VLANs) during server builds.
CLI Tool: For NetOps to perform ad-hoc activations or configuration adjustments.
Port Activation Service: Backend with a workflow engine to validate, authorize, and execute port activations and configuration changes, integrated into server build workflows.
Switch Controllers: To configure switches (via NETCONF, SNMP, or vendor APIs) for port activation and dynamic settings (e.g., VLANs, port modes).
Infrastructure: API gateway, database, and monitoring for security, logging, and observability.
The system will:

Automate port activation to speed up server builds.
Support dynamic switch configuration during build workflows (e.g., via API calls to set VLANs).
Prioritize scalability, security (RBAC, encryption), and auditability.

Notes for Management
Focus: Highlight how faster server builds (Metric 1) and dynamic configuration (Metric 2) drive revenue and flexibility, key concerns for management.
Visuals: Use a before vs. after chart (e.g., build time: 2 hours → 5 minutes) or a flowchart showing dynamic VLAN changes in the build workflow.
Q&A Prep: Anticipate:
“How do dynamic changes work?” (API/UI allows VLAN settings during builds.)
“What if configs fail?” (Validation and rollbacks ensure reliability.)
“How soon will builds be faster?” (Metrics visible within weeks of deployment.)
ADR Integration: The updated Success Metrics fit after Consequences, reinforcing Business Value.
Summary
The updated ADR incorporates the intentions to speed up server builds and enable dynamic switch configuration during build workflows. These are reflected in the Context (problem of slow, inflexible builds), Decision (API/UI support for dynamic changes), Consequences (faster builds, flexibility), and Success Metrics (80% faster activations, 100% config success). The metrics ensure measurable outcomes, proving value to management through revenue, cost, scalability, and trust.
