Architectural Decision Record: Automated Switch Port Activation System
Title
ADR-001: Implement a Centralized Automated Switch Port Activation System

Status
Proposed

Context
Manual switch port activation for servers is a critical bottleneck in data center operations, slowing server builds and limiting scalability. The current process:

Delays Server Builds: Manual port activation takes hours, delaying server provisioning and customer deployments, which impacts revenue.
Lacks Flexibility: Cannot dynamically change switch configurations (e.g., VLANs, port modes) during the server build workflow, requiring separate manual steps.
Causes Errors: Human errors lead to misconfigurations, causing downtime (estimated $Y per incident).
Unscalable: Struggles with growing demand (100-200 servers, thousands of ports).
To address these issues, we need a solution that:

Speeds up server builds by automating switch port activation as part of the provisioning process.
Enables dynamic switch configuration changes (e.g., VLAN assignments) during the server build workflow.
Supports web UI requests from requestors.
Allows API requests from automation controllers.
Handles bulk activation (thousands of ports) via scripts.
Provides a CLI for NetOps ad-hoc changes.
The solution must deliver faster server builds, flexible configuration, cost savings, scalability, and reliability, while ensuring security and ease of use.

Decision
We will build a Centralized Automated Switch Port Activation System with:

Web UI: For requestors to submit/track port activation and configuration requests.
RESTful API: For automation controllers and bulk scripts to trigger port activations and switch configuration changes (e.g., VLANs) during server builds.
CLI Tool: For NetOps to perform ad-hoc activations or configuration adjustments.
Port Activation Service: Backend with a workflow engine to validate, authorize, and execute port activations and configuration changes, integrated into server build workflows.
Switch Controllers: To configure switches (via NETCONF, SNMP, or vendor APIs) for port activation and dynamic settings (e.g., VLANs, port modes).
Infrastructure: API gateway, database, and monitoring for security, logging, and observability.
The system will:

Automate port activation to speed up server builds.
Support dynamic switch configuration during build workflows (e.g., via API calls to set VLANs).
Prioritize scalability, security (RBAC, encryption), and auditability.

Pros:
User-Friendly: Intuitive UI simplifies requests for non-technical users, reducing NetOps workload.
Tailored Control: Custom workflows ensure trading-specific validation and auditability.
Reliable: Workflow engine maintains < 0.1% error rate with human oversight.
Lower Complexity: No API/webhook development reduces build time (~12 weeks).
Cons:
Limited Automation: No API/webhooks hinders ITSM/CI/CD integration, slowing 600-server goal.
Scalability Issues: Manual UI inputs cannot handle bulk provisioning efficiently.
Approval Bottleneck: Still requires human coordination, not fully bypassing 17:00 SDM process.
Less Flexible: Lacks programmatic dynamic configuration for complex VLAN setups.
Why Considered: Simplifies development and user access but fails to meet automation and scalability needs.
Option 3: Vendor-Specific Tools (Cisco DNA Center, Cisco NSO, Arista CloudVision)
Overview: Adopt vendor-provided tools like Cisco DNA Center (centralized network management for Cisco devices), Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) (multi-vendor orchestration with model-based automation), or Arista CloudVision (network-wide automation with Zero Touch Provisioning and telemetry). These tools manage switch port activation and configuration but have limited API/webhook support for external integration.
Pros:
Quick Deployment: Pre-built tools deploy in ~8 weeks with vendor support.
Vendor Integration: Native compatibility with Cisco (DNA Center, NSO) or Arista (CloudVision) switches.
Reliability: Vendor-backed systems ensure stable port activation (e.g., CloudVision’s NetDB).
Automation Features: Cisco NSO supports multi-vendor provisioning; Arista CloudVision offers ZTP and workflow automation.
Cons:
High Cost: Expensive licensing and maintenance fees (e.g., Cisco DNA Center subscriptions).
Vendor Lock-In: Limited flexibility for diverse hardware (e.g., Cisco DNA Center primarily Cisco-focused).
Limited Integration: Weak API/webhook support restricts ITSM/CI/CD connectivity (e.g., CloudVision’s JSON APIs lack robust webhook triggers), risking 17:00 bottleneck.
Inflexible for Trading: Limited dynamic configuration for trading-specific VLANs or bulk provisioning at 600-server scale.
Why Considered: Offers rapid deployment and vendor reliability but compromises on cost, flexibility, and trading-specific automation needs.
Chosen Option: Option 1 (Custom System with API Support)
Rationale: Option 1 delivers the speed (80% faster activations), scalability (1000 ports in < 2 minutes), flexibility (100% dynamic configuration success), and integration (100% webhook reliability) needed to provision 600 servers per quarter and maintain market leadership in electronic trading. It avoids vendor lock-in, integrates with tools like ServiceNow/NetBox, and ensures cost savings (X hours/week). Option 2 lacks automation for bulk provisioning, and Option 3 (Cisco DNA Center, NSO, Arista CloudVision) sacrifices flexibility and integration, critical for trading competitiveness.
Vendor Tool Examples Explained
Based on web sources, the vendor-specific tools for Option 3 are:

Cisco DNA Center:
A centralized platform for managing Cisco networks, offering automation for configuration, provisioning, and monitoring. It provides a “single pane of glass” for network management but is primarily Cisco-focused, with limited multi-vendor support and weak webhook integration for ITSM/CI/CD.
Use Case: Automates port activation for Cisco switches but struggles with trading’s dynamic VLAN needs or non-Cisco hardware.
Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO):
A model-based orchestration tool supporting multi-vendor networks (e.g., Arista, Juniper) via Network Element Drivers (NEDs). It automates provisioning and configuration using open APIs but requires significant setup for webhook triggers and has high licensing costs.
Use Case: Suitable for multi-vendor provisioning but less tailored for trading’s bulk provisioning or real-time ITSM integration.
Arista CloudVision:
A turnkey platform for network-wide automation, leveraging Arista EOS and NetDB for Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP), configuration management, and telemetry. It supports JSON APIs and some third-party integration (e.g., ServiceNow) but lacks robust webhook support for event-driven triggers.
Use Case: Efficient for Arista switches with ZTP but limited for trading’s 600-server scale or non-Arista environments.
These tools were selected as examples due to their prominence in network automation for Cisco and Arista ecosystems, as evidenced by industry sources.

Integration into ADR
This Considered Options section replaces the previous version, maintaining alignment with the problem statement (provisioning 600 servers/quarter, hindered by manual port activation), success metrics (e.g., 80% faster activations, 100% webhook reliability), and business value (market leadership, cost savings). The vendor tool examples enhance Option 3’s specificity, clarifying their strengths (rapid deployment, vendor integration) and limitations (cost, lock-in, integration gaps) for trading’s needs. The full ADR remains unchanged except for this section, preserving the webhook inclusion, implementation plan, and other components.
